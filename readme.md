## 2021 & Earlier – Foundations

> Before the big events and long tables, this is where curiosity turned into contribution.

| Year | Highlights                                                                                  |

| 2019 | First experiments with cloud, initial public sharing, mentoring in local circles            |

---

## How This Repo Works

- **Single source of truth:**  
  Every community activity — **talks, organizing, blogs, newsletter issues, mentoring highlights** — should be represented here.

- **Year-based sections:**  
  Each year gets:
  - A table for **Talks, Workshops & Events**
  - A bullet list (or sub-section) for **Writing & Content**
  - Optional notes for **Books, Reviews, Product feedback**

- **Workflow for updates:**
  1. Add new confirmed talks or events to **“Up Next”**.  
  2. After the event, move the row into the correct year’s table.  
  3. When you publish a new blog or newsletter issue, add a one-liner under that year’s *Writing & Content*.  

- **Goal:**  
  Make it easy for anyone (AWS, conference organizers, collaborators, mentees) to see **the full arc of your community impact** — and for you to look back and see how far you’ve come.
